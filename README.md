## AI Stack — Migration from Claude + Voyage to Gemini

SpendWise originally shipped with **Claude Sonnet 4.6** (Anthropic) for chat and recommendations, and **Voyage AI `voyage-3-lite`** for embeddings. That stack worked well:

- Claude's structured JSON output mode produced reliably parseable recommendation payloads
- Voyage AI's `voyage-3-lite` model was specifically tuned for short multilingual text, which suited Indian bank transaction descriptions well
- Embeddings were stored as 512-dim vectors with an HNSW index in pgvector

**Why the migration?**

Cost. Running Claude Sonnet 4.6 at even moderate traffic is expensive — Anthropic charges per input/output token with no free tier. Voyage AI similarly has no meaningful free tier. For a personal project or early-stage product, this was unsustainable.

Google Gemini provides a **generous free tier** via Google AI Studio (`gemini-3.1-flash-lite` and `gemini-embedding-2` are both available on the free plan), which made the switch an easy cost-cutting decision without compromising capability.

**What changed:**

| Component | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Chat / Recommendations | Claude Sonnet 4.6 (Anthropic SDK) | `gemini-3.1-flash-lite` (Google Generative AI SDK) |
| Embeddings | Voyage AI `voyage-3-lite` (512-dim) | `gemini-embedding-2` with `outputDimensionality: 768` |
| API key env var | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` + `VOYAGE_API_KEY` | `GEMINI_API_KEY` (single key) |
| DB vector column | `vector(512)` | `vector(768)` |
| SDK | `@anthropic-ai/sdk` + `voyageai` | `@google/generative-ai` |

**Noteworthy engineering detail — matryoshka truncation:** `gemini-embedding-2` natively outputs 3072-dim vectors. The Google SDK accepts an `outputDimensionality` parameter that truncates using matryoshka representation learning — meaning the first N dimensions of a longer embedding preserve the same semantic quality as a native N-dim model. Setting `outputDimensionality: 768` keeps the DB schema lean while retaining strong retrieval quality.

**What stayed the same:** The RAG architecture, pgvector cosine search, HNSW index, BullMQ job pipeline, and all rate-limiting logic are unchanged. The migration was purely a provider swap — no business logic was rewritten.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20+**
- **PostgreSQL 16** with the `pgvector` extension (`CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;`)
- **Redis 7**

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/snehaldevrani/SpendWise.git
cd SpendWise
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

```bash
# API
cp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env

# Web (only one variable needed)
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env.local
```

Fill in `apps/api/.env`:

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/spendwise?schema=public"
REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379"
JWT_SECRET="<min 32 chars>"
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET="<min 32 chars>"
GEMINI_API_KEY="AQ..."              # from aistudio.google.com/apikey — free tier keys start with AQ.
RESEND_API_KEY="re_..."             # from resend.com — required for password reset emails
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL="onboarding@resend.dev"  # Resend's built-in test address, no domain verification needed
FRONTEND_URL="http://localhost:3000"
PORT=3001
# Google OAuth — required for "Continue with Google" on login/signup
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="<OAuth 2.0 Client ID from console.cloud.google.com>"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="<OAuth 2.0 Client Secret>"
GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL="http://localhost:3001/api/auth/google/callback"
```

API keys:
- **Google Gemini** — [aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) (free tier, no credit card)
- **Resend** — [resend.com](https://resend.com) (free tier, 3,000 emails/month — needed for password reset emails; use `onboarding@resend.dev` as `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` for zero-config sending)
- **Google OAuth** — [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com) → APIs & Services → Credentials → OAuth 2.0 Client ID (Web application); add `http://localhost:3001/api/auth/google/callback` as authorised redirect URI

### 3. Set up the database

```bash
cd apps/api
npx prisma migrate deploy    # apply all migrations (includes pgvector extension + HNSW index)
npx prisma generate          # generate Prisma client
cd ../..
```

### 4. Run in development

```bash
npm run dev
```

| Service | URL |
|---------|-----|
| Frontend | http://localhost:3000 |
| API | http://localhost:3001/api |
| Swagger docs | http://localhost:3001/api/docs |

## Docker (recommended for production)

The `docker-compose.yml` spins up all 5 services:

```bash
# Create a .env file at the repo root with your secrets (same keys as apps/api/.env)
cp apps/api/.env.example .env

docker compose up --build
```

| Container | Role |
|-----------|------|
| `postgres` | PostgreSQL 16 + pgvector |
| `redis` | Redis 7 |
| `api` | NestJS HTTP server — runs `prisma migrate deploy` on startup |
| `worker` | BullMQ import-queue processor (separate process, no HTTP) |
| `web` | Next.js standalone build |

---

## How to Use

### 1. Create an account

Go to `/signup`, enter your email and a password.

### 2. Export your bank statement

SpendWise supports **HDFC, ICICI, SBI, Axis Bank, and Kotak** statement exports in **CSV, Excel (XLSX), and PDF** formats.

| Bank | Export path |
|------|------------|
| HDFC | Net Banking → Accounts → Download Statement → CSV or PDF |
| ICICI | Net Banking → Statements → Download → Excel/CSV or PDF |
| SBI | YONO / Net Banking → e-Statements → Date range → Download CSV or PDF |
| Axis | Net Banking → Accounts → Account Statement → CSV or PDF Download |
| Kotak | Net Banking → Accounts → Statements → Download → Excel or PDF |

> **PDF note:** Only digital (text-based) PDFs are supported — the kind you download from net banking. Scanned / image PDFs will not parse.

The file must include at minimum: a **date column**, a **description/narration column**, and **debit/credit amount columns**. Column names are normalised automatically.

### 3. Upload

Click **Upload Statement** from the sidebar or dashboard. After upload, three background jobs run:

1. **Embed** — each transaction is embedded with Gemini `gemini-embedding-2` (768-dim) and stored in pgvector
2. **Detect subscriptions** — recurring charges are scored and flagged
3. **Compute insights** — weekly summaries are calculated

The upload dialog shows **live step indicators** for all three jobs as they complete, powered by an SSE stream from the API. Processing typically completes in under 30 seconds.

> **PDF uploads:** `pdf-parse` extracts text from digital PDFs. Each line beginning with a date pattern is treated as a transaction row. Works with all major Indian bank digital statements.

### 4. Dashboard

The dashboard shows:
- Stat cards with a **date range dropdown** — choose This month, Last 2 months, Last 3 months, or Last 6 months. Single-month view shows This Month vs Last Month spend comparison; multi-month view shows aggregated Money Out / Money In / Net Savings
- Daily spending area chart (last 60 days)
- Monthly category donut chart
- 5 most recent transactions
- AI savings recommendation card

### 5. Transactions

Full transaction table with search, category filter, and date range filter. Edit any category inline if the auto-classification is wrong. Export the current filtered view as CSV.

### 6. Subscriptions

Recurring charges detected by the algorithm, each showing:
- Billing cycle (weekly / monthly / annual / custom)
- Confidence score
- Estimated annual cost
- **Likely unused** flag if no recent charge

Click **Dismiss** on false positives (e.g. rent). Click **Confirm** to lock in a detected subscription.

### 7. Budgets

Set per-category spending limits. Each budget card shows:
- Live progress bar (green → amber → red as you approach the limit)
- Prorated month-end forecast
- Remaining balance
- Overall budget health score

Toggle **Recurring** when creating a budget — it applies automatically every month. An explicit budget for a specific month always overrides the recurring one for that month.

### 8. Insights

Two panels:
- **6-month category trends** — stacked bar chart across the last 6 months
- **Weekly insight cards** — spend/income/savings per ISO week with category breakdown and top merchants

### 9. AI Chat

Ask any question about your spending history. The assistant retrieves your most relevant transactions before answering.

**Example questions:**
- "How much did I spend on food in April?"
- "What was my biggest single expense last month?"
- "Which week did I spend the most overall?"
- "Am I spending more on subscriptions than last quarter?"

Rate limits: 20 chat messages/day · 4 AI recommendation calls/day (per user).

### 10. Settings

Toggle email notifications:
- **Weekly digest** — Monday summary email
- **New subscription alert** — email when a new leak is detected
- **Spending spike alert** — email when weekly spend is unusually high

---

## Security

- Passwords hashed with **bcrypt** (12 rounds)
- Tokens stored in **httpOnly SameSite=Lax cookies** — inaccessible to JavaScript
- Refresh tokens **hashed in the database** — a leaked DB row cannot be replayed
- **Atomic refresh token rotation** — old token deleted and new token inserted in a single Prisma transaction
- **Helmet** with a strict Content Security Policy (`script-src 'self'`, no inline scripts)
- **File upload magic-byte validation** — XLSX/XLS/PDF files are rejected if content doesn't match expected binary signatures
- **UPI reference ID sanitisation** — raw UPI transaction IDs (e.g. `UPIAR/013914520250/DR/`) are stripped from merchant names before any data is sent to the Gemini API, reducing financial PII exposure
- **Per-user AI rate limits** — Redis counters with 24h TTL
- **Redis-backed rate limiting** — `@nest-lab/throttler-storage-redis` ensures rate limit counters survive server restarts; auth endpoints throttled to 5/15 min, uploads to 10/hour, password reset to 3/hour
- **Password reset via email** — single-use bcrypt-hashed token, 1-hour expiry; all sessions revoked on reset
- **Google OAuth** — `passport-google-oauth20`; `prompt: 'select_account'` forces account picker on every sign-in; after Google's callback the API redirects to `/callback` (not directly to `/dashboard`) so the Next.js client can call `/users/me`, populate the Zustand auth store, and then navigate to `/dashboard`; `AuthGuard` always calls `/users/me` on every mount — no fast-path bypass — closing the stale-session window
- **ThrottlerGuard registered as global APP_GUARD** — all `@Throttle()` decorators are now actively enforced; auth endpoints: 5 req/15 min; uploads: 10/hour; password reset: 3/hour
- **SSE job ownership check** — `GET /uploads/progress` verifies `job.data.userId === authenticatedUser.id`; prevents polling another user's import jobs
- **Strict MIME type allowlist on upload** — only `text/csv`, `application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet` (.xlsx), and `application/pdf` accepted; `application/octet-stream`, `text/plain`, and `application/vnd.ms-excel` (.xls) removed
- **xlsx package replaced with exceljs** — dropped abandoned `xlsx@0.18.5` (known prototype-pollution and ReDoS CVEs) in favour of actively maintained `exceljs@4.4.0`; legacy `.xls` (OLE2) format no longer accepted — only `.xlsx` (OOXML/ZIP) files are supported
- **`@MaxLength(128)` on all password DTO fields** — caps both bcrypt and regex work on public auth endpoints; prevents ReDoS amplification attacks
- **`@Max(9_999_999)` on budget `limitAmount`** — prevents `Infinity`/numeric overflow reaching the DB
- **`@ArrayMaxSize(50)` + `@MaxLength(2000)` on AI chat history** — prevents token-stuffing (previously unbounded history could send megabytes per request to Gemini)
- **CSV/XLSX row + column + amount caps** — 10,000 row limit, 50 column limit, ₹1 billion amount cap; prevents DoS via oversized sheets
- **Password reset O(1) lookup** — reset URL now includes `?id=<recordId>` for direct DB lookup; eliminates O(N) bcrypt scan across all active tokens
- **AI prompt injection hardening** — merchant names sanitized (`sanitizeForPrompt`: strip `\r\n\x00`, truncate to 100 chars); user chat question stripped of control characters before `sendMessage` to prevent delimiter-escape attacks; system instruction anti-injection framing; `--- BEGIN/END TRANSACTION DATA ---` and `--- USER QUESTION ---` delimiters in every Gemini call
- **Duplicate category guard** — `CustomCategoriesService.create()` checks for an existing `(userId, slug)` pair before the `prisma.customCategory.create()` call and throws a `ConflictException` (409); without this, Prisma's `@@unique([userId, slug])` constraint violation surfaced as an unhandled 500
- **Frontend error message whitelisting** — raw server error strings in upload toasts, password-change toasts, and AI chat replaced with keyword-whitelisted or static fallbacks; prevents internal error details leaking to the UI
- **Redis TLS cert validation configurable** — `rejectUnauthorized` controlled by `REDIS_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED` env var; defaults to `true` in production; set to `'false'` only in dev
- **Swagger UI hidden in production** — `SwaggerModule.setup()` only runs when `NODE_ENV !== 'production'`
- **PII removed from log messages** — email addresses replaced with user IDs in all server log output
- **Google OAuth startup warning** — `GoogleStrategy` emits a `Logger.warn` at boot if `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` or `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` is missing; missing OAuth credentials surface immediately in logs rather than silently 500-ing at login time
- **Privacy policy page** at `/privacy` — documents all data flows including what Gemini receives
- **Constant-time login** — `bcrypt.compare` runs against a dummy hash even when the email doesn't exist; eliminates the ~100 ms vs ~1 ms timing oracle that would otherwise reveal valid email addresses via response time
- **Stateless Google OAuth** — `state: true` was intentionally removed from `GoogleStrategy`; the app uses JWT cookies (not sessions), so `express-session` is never set up — `state: true` requires session middleware and caused a 500 on every OAuth attempt by trying to write a nonce to `req.session` which was always `undefined`. Stateless OAuth is safe here because the callback URL itself validates that Google is calling back to our registered server.
- **RAG UPDATE scoped to user** — `UPDATE transactions SET embedding = ...` includes `AND user_id = $userId` guard; closes a defense-in-depth gap where the SELECT was already scoped but the UPDATE was not
- **`@MaxLength` on email and token DTO fields** — `email` fields capped at 254 chars (RFC 5321 max); `refreshToken` at 1024 chars; `token` and `recordId` on reset-password capped at 512 / 36 chars; prevents long-string DoS via JWT verification and validator.js regex on public endpoints
- **HTML escaping in email templates** — merchant names from CSV/PDF data are escaped (`&`, `<`, `>`, `"`, `'`) before insertion into Resend HTML email bodies; prevents XSS payloads in HTML-capable email clients
- **`@Throttle` on AI endpoints** — `GET /ai/recommendations` limited to 10 req/min, `POST /ai/chat` to 30 req/min per user; separate from the daily Redis counters; prevents per-burst token-amplification attacks
- **Transaction query parameter bounds** — `?days` clamped to 1–365, `?months` to 1–24, `?month`/`?year` validated to real calendar ranges (2000–2100); date-range queries validate ISO format and reject ranges over 2 years; prevents billion-iteration loops and full-table scans via crafted query strings
- **Next.js security headers** — `headers()` export in `next.config.ts` sets `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`, and a `Content-Security-Policy` (including `connect-src` scoped to the API origin) on every page response
- **CORS explicit config** — `app.enableCors()` specifies exact `methods`, `allowedHeaders`, and `origin`; removes the default behaviour of reflecting any method or header from preflight requests
- **GuestGuard server-side verification** — login/signup pages call `GET /users/me` before rendering; active sessions are redirected to dashboard without relying on stale Zustand state, eliminating redirect-loop scenarios after cookie expiry
- **Zustand persisted to localStorage** — both `useChatStore` and `useAuthStore` use a custom `localStorage` adapter; chat history survives page refreshes and new tabs; financial data is still cleared explicitly on logout via `clearHistory()`, preventing data leakage between users on the same device
- **PDF parser row ceiling** — `parsePdf()` now enforces the same `MAX_ROWS = 10,000` limit as CSV/XLSX parsers; previously the PDF path had no cap, allowing unbounded memory use via crafted large PDFs
- **Production log level restriction** — NestJS app created with `logger: ['log', 'warn', 'error']` in production; `debug` and `verbose` levels (which can emit request bodies and token fragments) are only enabled in development

## Background Job Pipeline

```
CSV / XLSX / PDF upload
    │
    ├─► JOB_EMBED_TRANSACTIONS
    │       Generate Gemini gemini-embedding-2 embeddings (768-dim) → upsert into pgvector
    │
    ├─► JOB_DETECT_SUBSCRIPTIONS
    │       Group by merchant → compute interval stddev → score confidence
    │       → upsert Subscription records → send email alert if new leaks found
    │
    └─► JOB_COMPUTE_INSIGHTS
            Group by ISO week → compute totals, category breakdown, top merchants
            → upsert weekly Insight records

All 3 job IDs returned in POST /uploads/csv response → frontend opens
EventSource to GET /uploads/progress?jobs=id1,id2,id3 → SSE stream
pushes per-job status every 1.5 s until all complete.

Weekly cron (Mon 08:00 IST):
    └─► Send weekly digest email to opted-in users
```

All jobs use 3-attempt exponential-backoff retry. The BullMQ worker runs as a **separate process** (`worker.ts`) so heavy uploads cannot starve the HTTP server.

## Deployment (free tier)

The recommended zero-cost production stack:

| Service | Platform | What runs there | URL |
|---------|----------|-----------------|-----|
| Frontend | [Vercel](https://vercel.com) | Next.js app | [spendwise-web-nine.vercel.app](https://spendwise-web-nine.vercel.app) |
| API | [Render](https://render.com) Web Service | NestJS + BullMQ workers + auto-migrate on startup | [spendwise-api-q01j.onrender.com](https://spendwise-api-q01j.onrender.com) |
| Postgres | [Neon](https://neon.tech) | PostgreSQL 16 + pgvector | — |
| Redis | [Upstash](https://upstash.com) | Redis 7 (`rediss://` TLS) | — |

> **Note:** BullMQ job processors (`JOB_EMBED_TRANSACTIONS`, `JOB_DETECT_SUBSCRIPTIONS`, `JOB_COMPUTE_INSIGHTS`) run inside the API process — no separate worker service required. The `worker.ts` entry point exists for scale-out if needed.

> Render free tier spins down after 15 min of inactivity — first request may take ~30 s. Acceptable for portfolio/demo use.

### Environment variables (Render API service)

```env
DATABASE_URL=<neon postgres connection string>
REDIS_URL=<upstash rediss:// url>
JWT_SECRET=<32+ char random string>
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=15m
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=<32+ char random string>
JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRES_IN=7d
GEMINI_API_KEY=<from aistudio.google.com/apikey — free tier keys start with AQ.>
RESEND_API_KEY=re_...
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=onboarding@resend.dev
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<OAuth 2.0 Client ID from console.cloud.google.com>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<OAuth 2.0 Client Secret>
GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL=https://<your-render-api-url>/api/auth/google/callback
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3001
FRONTEND_URL=https://<your-vercel-url>.vercel.app
# Optional — only needed in local dev with self-signed Redis certs
# REDIS_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=false
```

### Vercel environment variable

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://<your-render-api-url>/api
```

### Deploy order

1. **Neon** — create project → copy `DATABASE_URL` (pgvector is pre-installed)
2. **Upstash** — create Redis database → copy `REDIS_URL`
3. **Resend** — sign up at [resend.com](https://resend.com) → copy API key; set `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=onboarding@resend.dev` (Resend's built-in test sender — works on free tier with no domain verification)
4. **Google OAuth** — [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com) → create project → APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen (External) → Credentials → OAuth 2.0 Client ID (Web application) → add Render callback URL as authorised redirect URI and Vercel URL as authorised JavaScript origin; copy Client ID + Secret
5. **Render API** — new Web Service → Docker → Dockerfile path `./apps/api/Dockerfile` → set all env vars (including `RESEND_*` and `GOOGLE_*`) → deploy → copy service URL
6. **Vercel** — import repo → root directory `apps/web` → set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://<render-url>/api` → deploy → copy Vercel URL → update `FRONTEND_URL` on Render; also add the Vercel URL as an authorised JavaScript origin in Google Console

The API container runs `prisma migrate deploy` automatically on every startup, so the Neon schema is always in sync with the code.
